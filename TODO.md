# TODO

- [ ] Add 'checkpairs' command to check integrity and pairing of input files. Good validation to have before running large-scale projects.
- [ ] Refactor code to use Moo and App::Cmd for easier extension and development.
- [ ] Use low-level, faster interface for handling of FASTQ data.
- [ ] Add docker build.
- [ ] Add nextflow recipe so users can easily run utilities at scale across many files or machines.
